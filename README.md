An overview over the projects I've been a part of. 

###### TW Github md syntax
Okay, so I _know_ that I'm manhandling the precious github markdown-syntax in this repo, but I had to fix the layout somehow. If you're sensitive about that kind of thing you've been fairly warned. 

### Projects

>**Note**
>#### A note about Project management
> 
>I can throw around a bunch of project management terms like scrum, agile, trello, kanban boards etc. as much as the next guy - but it's basically just name dropping tools. What I did was making sure people kept their focus, encouraged them to help each other out and keeping the weekly goal concrete. This is something I've been responsible for in all of the projects I've been part of and in the interest of keeping things DRY I'll just refer back to this note when needed.

### Losing My Marbles
![[Losing my marbles title.png]](https://github.com/emilxf-0/Portfolio/blob/main/Images/Losing%20my%20marbles%20title.png)

<details open>
 
 >**Developed:** 2022 Nov - 2023 Jan

>**Language:** C#

>**Networking:** Firebase

>**Genre:** Couch co-op, Party game, Tactical puzzle
</details>

### Overview

Losing my marbles is a semi online, couch co-op game where you and your friends use your mobile phones to control your characters. Drawing inspiration from classic board game [RoboRally](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/18/roborally) and party game favorite [Jackbox](https://www.jackboxgames.com/) we created a 2D puzzle/race game as a 7-week project at [Yrgo](https://www.yrgo.se).

### My contribution

**Networking**

I was responsible for making networking work. That meant setting up a database that Unity could talk to, create a lobby to ensure that we could run more than one game at a time (fairly important in terms of scalability), and create the controllers.

## Flesh and Stone

<details open>
 
 >**Developed:** 2023 March - 2023 May
>
>**Engine:** Unreal 5
>
>**Language:** Blueprints
>
>**Genre:** Single player, 3rd person, Hack n slash
</details>
### Overview

Flesh and Stone is a super stylized hack n slash game in the vein of DMC and God of War. We wanted to do something that had the same speedy feel like Doom but that heavily incorporates melee combat.

### My contribution

**Combat system** 

I was responsible for making combat feel crunchy, impactful and intuitive. That meant setting up key bindings and blue prints that handled both singular attacks and combos. I worked extensively with timing and to gracefully add interactivity to the animations made by the animator.

## Get Up

>**Genre:** VR, Single player, Walking simulator
</details>

### Overview
Get up is a VR walking sim set at the bottom of a pit. The goal is simply to walk to the top by balancing on some sketchy ass boards. 

### My contribution

**Vertical movement and foot tracking**
We wanted to explore spatial movement and the challenges of mitigating motion sickness due to the disconnect between perceived and physical movement. To do that we had to find a way for the player to move around in a limited space but still get the benefits of a relatively large game world. By letting the player move in a spiral motion we could keep the need for space to a minimum. VR doesn't play very nicely with collision since there is no way to stop the player from just moving indefinitely (barring physically restricting them, thankfully there are laws in place to stop of us from doing that) which usually means the world gets offset and mess up the placement of the game world.
