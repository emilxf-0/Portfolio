### Overview

Losing my marbles is a semi online, couch co-op game where you and your friends use your mobile phones to control your characters. Drawing inspiration from classic board game [RoboRally](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/18/roborally) and party game favorite [Jackbox](https://www.jackboxgames.com/) we created a 2D puzzle/race game as a 7-week project at [Yrgo](https://www.yrgo.se).
